# Charta Caeli web service
A web frontend to the Charta Caeli star chart creation tool. The web service is basically made up of an UI and a REST API connecting the UI with the Charta Caeli core application. The UI utilizes Bootstrap 4 for responsiveness. Another major component is the [Xonomy XML editor](https://github.com/michmech/xonomy) which provides a way to edit star chart definitions on devices with appropriate display sizes.

### Build
The project depends on the [repository](https://github.com/otabuzzman/chartacaeli) of the Charta Caeli star chart creation tool (core application). Thus, to setup the web service, one first has to download and build the core app according to instructions given there. Afterwards clone this repository and follow steps listed below. Run clone commands from same folder to make sure top-level directories of core app and web service share the same parent folder.
- Change directory (bash) to top-level directory of Charta Caeli web service.
- Run build commands:
  ```
  make all
  ```

- To rebuild the images (for instance to check if the core app works) run:
  ```
  # Windows
  export GS_FONTPATH=c:/users/jschuck/src/chartacaeli-web\;c:/users/jschuck/src/chartacaeli
  # Linux
  export GS_FONTPATH=~/lab/chartacaeli-web:~/lab/chartacaeli

  make pdf png gng
  make install
  ```

### Notes during development

#### Xonomy web XML editor
Install XMLStarlet
- needs libxml2 and libxslt
- expects /usr/include/libxml

Cues for Cygwin
- install libxml2 and libxml2-devel packages
- install libxslt and libxslt-devel packages
- `cd /usr/include ; ln -s libxml2/libxml libxml`

Sample commands to check document specification for missing elements, attributes and patterns.
```
# elements
for e in `xml sel -t -v "//xs:element/@name" chartacaeli.xsd | sort -u` ; do \
	echo -n $e " " ; egrep -c "^\s*\"$e\"" web/lib/chartacaeli.xsd.js ; done |\
	grep '0$'

# attributes
for a in `xml sel -t -v "//xs:attribute/@name" chartacaeli.xsd | sort -u` ; do \
	echo -n $a " " ; egrep -c "^\s*\"$a\"" web/lib/chartacaeli.xsd.js ; done |\
	grep '0$'

# patterns
for p in `xml sel -t -v "//xs:pattern/@value" chartacaeli.xsd | sort -u` ; do \
	echo -n $p " " ; egrep -c "^\s*{value: \"$p\"" web/lib/chartacaeli.xsd.js ; done |\
	grep '0$'
```

#### Content preparation
Favicon creation
- Icon sketched with Google Slides but defined with Microsoft Powerpoint because Slides lacks some GUI features (e.g. setting arbitrary linewidths, capstyles and numerical rotation angles).
- Icon text in Justinian font made with Powerpoint. Set background transparent. Save text element as graphic via context menu.
- Combine icon and text images with Slides.
- Use the [IcoMoon](https://icomoon.io/) Chrome extension to generate custom fonts from SVG icons. Avoid using strokes. If not possible use [INKSCAPE](https://inkscape.org/) to [convert strokes to fills](https://inkscape.org/doc/tutorials/advanced/tutorial-advanced.html) ([tooltip](lab/inkscape-tooltip-stroke-to-fill.png)).

Subordinate styles of buttons and links.

#### Thoughts on links
Purposes of links in running text is provision of background information or to give credit to the efforts of individual projects used by the site. Another reason is to ease access to sites which might somewhat tricky to find with Google even if propper keywords are given.

*Rules of thumb*
- No reference of sites everbody knows (e.g. Amazon, Google, Micosoft).
- Only one reference at first occurence.
- URLs should be limited to the host part as site structures are subject to changes.
- Preference of Wikipedia entries because site structure of Wikipedia is considered stable (based on the assumption that entries are kept up-to-date).
- References of books on Amazon with unambiguous search queries because direct links tend to be very long.
- Unsecure sites referenced with unambiguous Google search queries resulting (ideally) in a top-ranked result.

|Type|Comment|
|----|-------|
|Navigation menu entry|Primary color 10% darkened for `:hover` and 15% for `:active`.|
|URL in text (inline)|Same as for navigation menu entries. No text decorations.|

#### REST setup
Installation and configuration of Tomcat performed according to these [practice notes](http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/howto/tomcat_howto.html) from [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/home.aspx) (Singapore). Page provides useful newbie information on TC setup including first *Hello World* servlet. Create `${CATALINA_HOME}/conf/Catalina/localhost/ROOT.xml` with content `<Context docBase="<appbase>" path="" reloadable="true"/>` and `<appbase>` set appropriately (e.g. `c:\users\<user>\src\chartacaeli-web\web`) to make Charta Caeli default (start on domain URL).

Charta Caeli web service REST API implementaion uses [Jersey](https://jersey.github.io/) RESTful Web Service framework.
